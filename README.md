# simplified-process-and-resource-manager
In this project, we will examine the portion of the kernel that addresses the management of processes and resources. We will develop a system that will allow us to create the data structures to represent processes and resources. We will also implement the oper- ations invoked by processes to manipulate other processes or to request/release various resources. In the extended version of the manager, we will also implement operations that emulate the actions of hardware interrupts. The manager will be tested using a pre- sentation shell developed as part of the project. This will allow us to test the manager without running the actual processes and using the machineâ€™s actual hardware interrupts. Instead, the presentation shell will play the role of both the currently running process and the hardware; it will accept commands typed in by the user, and will invoke the corresponding function of the manager.
